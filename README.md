# CollectionFS Demo

Demo for the `devel` branch of CollectionFS. Updated 4/2/14 to reflect the latest changes to the API.

## Getting Started

1. `git clone https://github.com/copleykj/CollectionFS-Demo.git`

2. Run `mrt install`

3. Add any of the dependent packages to meteor by running `meteor add packageName`

4. Install graphics magick on your system.


## Dependent Packages.

When installing in your own project you will have to add the cfs-gridfs, cfs-filesystem, cfs-handlebars, and cfs-graphics magic using `meteor add` even after adding them to your smart.json.

*Install graphics magick on your system to use the cfs-graphicsmagick features*

##Styles

When creating this project I used Compass and Susy SASS frameworks. They are not required to run the project but if you wish to use this for the base of another project you'll need to install SASS, Compass and Susy.
